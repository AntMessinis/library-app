# library-app (This project is still Under Development)
This project is made as the final project for AUEB's Coding Factory Java course. 
I'm building it with JavaEE - Maven - JDBC - JSP - JavaScript - JQuery - Jackson Databind - Bootstrap - MySQL - Service Oriented Architecture.

Library App is a web application where you can register, log in as a member or an Admin, browse the book collection and if a book is availible, the user can request to borrow it. 

The goal for this project is to function mostly as a Single Page Application. Most of the functions implemented work by sending or requesting data as json to/from rest servlets.  

I'm also using JavaScript with jQuery to prossess the data but I'm planning to remake the whole project in .NET with Blazor, WEBApi and Entity Framework.
