# library-app (Under Development)
This is project is made as the final project for AUEB's Coding Factory program. 
I'm building it with JavaEE - Maven - JDBC - JSP - JavaScript - JQuery - Bootstrap - MySQL - Service Oriented Architecture. 
Library App is a web application where you can register, log in as a member or an Admin, browse the book collection and if a book is availible the user can request to borrow it. 
Additionaly the Admin can add, update or delete books,authors or categories from the Library App and gains access to some data such us which user borrowed the most books the past 3 months,which category is the most popylar and how many people didn't return the book on time.
The Analytics part and half of the Admin CRUD functions are to be implemented soon.
